## General Safety Guidelines

<Aside type="caution" title="Caution">
  Before performing any maintenace work, turn the ignition key to the off position, press the E-Stop, and engage the manual brake. This is the best way to ensure that the machine cannot drive during maintenance work.

Under normal usage, the GR96 requires zero regular maintenance work, with the exception of [castor lubrication](/maintenance/lubrication). If you keep the machine [clean](/maintenance/cleaning) and all the [fasteners tightened](/maintenance/fasteners), the GR96 should give you years of worry-free productivity.
