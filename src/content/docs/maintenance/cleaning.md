## General Note

* Generally, air blowing and wiping are the preferred methods to keep the GR-96 clean.
* The machine can be washed with water, but we recommend that you keep electrical components and wiring away from water as much as possible, and dry off quickly afterwards.
* Although GR-96 is designed to be splash-proof, you should never submerge the machine in water or pressure-wash it.

## Spreader (Hopper) Cleaning

HOPPER CLEANING:
* Use appropriate footwear, eye protection, and cloth-
ing when cleaning the spreader.
* The key to years of trouble-free service is to keep your
spreader clean and dry.
* Never allow material to remain in hopper for extended
periods of time.
* Empty material from hopper at the end of each day.
* Use a hose or wipe excess material off of the spreader
at the end of each day.
* Open and close the gate as you rinse to avoid buildup
of material.
* Quickly towel dry the spreader.

## Sprayer System Cleaning

* As much as possible, rinse the spray system after each day of use. It will help maximize the life of sprayer components.
* How to rinse the spray system
  * Empty liquid
  * Fill tanks with water, and run spray boom for XX minutes
  * Run water out of the hand spray for XX minutes
