## Flushing the Spray System

For best performance and to maximize life of the spray components, we recommend that the spray system is flushed with water after each use. Leaving chemicals in the system for extended period of time may lead to clogs, cracks and leaks, or other problems.

## Filters and Strainers

There are is a in-line strainer underneath the tank on the left side. Also, each of the spray boom nozzles contains a filter as well. They should all be removed and inspected regularly. If needed, clean or replace the filter elements.
