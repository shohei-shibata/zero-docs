## Before storing the GR-96 for the winter

Follow the tips below to ensure that your GR-96 will be in great shape when you are ready to use it again in the spring.

### Filling the spray system with antifreeze

1. Drain any remaining chemicals from the tanks.
2. Fill the tank with antifreeze, enough to fill the system (including the hand spray reel!).
3. Open spray valves, then toggle the SPRAY MODE switch to ON position.
4. Once the antifreeze has started to come out of all boom nozzles, switch the SPRAY MODE back to OFF position.
5. Take the hand spray wand and point it into a bucket.
6. Switch on the WAND PUMP until the antifreeze has started to come out of the hand spray wand.
7. Switch off the WAND PUMP.

## Battery maintenance during winter

Although the Lithium Ion batteries used in the GR-96 will hold charge for a very long time, you should still charge them fully every 2 weeks or so to eliminate any risk of battery damage due to depleting them too far.
