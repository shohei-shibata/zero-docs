During machine startup, it will look for neutral throttle bar input before putting the machine in a "ready to drive" state. Once the LED indicator turns green and you hear a short beep, you will know that the machine is ready to be driven.

If the LED stays red, check to make sure that the throttle bar is centered. If that does not solve the problem, try [calibrating the throttle](/operations/throttle-calibration).
