If you are not able to put the GR96 in drive mode, below are the most likely possibilities.

## Throttle is not neutral

During machine startup, it will look for neutral throttle bar input before putting the machine in a "ready to drive" state. Once the LED indicator turns green and you hear a short beep, you will know that the machine is ready to be driven.

If the LED stays red, check to make sure that the throttle bar is centered. If that does not solve the problem, try [calibrating the throttle](/operations/throttle-calibration).

## Battery is dead

If the LED light does not come on when you turn the ignition key, the batteries are likely fully depleted. Or, if the batteries are nearly empty but not completely, the LED may come on but the machine may not be able to drive, or only be able to drive very sluggishly.

You can confirm the battery's remaining charge through the battery monitor at the center of the dashboard. Press the up or down buttons until the State of Charge is displayed.

When the battery is dead, you can push or tow the GR96 by using the [motor disconnect feature](/troubleshooting/dead-battery).
