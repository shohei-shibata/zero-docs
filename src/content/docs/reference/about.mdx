## Machine Usage

The GR96 has been tested vigorously to ensure the operator's safety as well as the durability of the equipment. As long as the product is used in manners that are described in this manual, and within the conditions and the limitations defined also in this document, the GR96 will provide many years of safety and productivity with minimal maintenance. However, the GR96 is a powerful machine that could cause injury and/or damage when not used properly. Please read this instruction manual carefuly, always take caution when operating it, and when there are any questions, please reach out to your place of purchase or to the ZERO Turf Machines support team.

## Battery Life

No matter which model you choose, you can expect the GR96 to last through a full day of use with plenty of charge remaining.

Actual battery life will vary depending on operating conditions (temperature, grade, driving habits, etc.). As a general guideline, however, you can expect:

* Model GR96-XR to last three full days of use
* Model GR96-SR to last one and a half days of use

If you feel that the battery life of your GR96 is significantly less, visit the [troubleshooting section](/troubleshooting/battery-capacity) to learn how to test your battery.

## Charging

Please do not use a charger other than the one provided by ZERO Turf Machines. Use of an unapproved charger will void the warranty.

Refer to the [Charging Instructions](/operations/charging) for details on how to charge the battery.
