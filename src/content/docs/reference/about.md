## Models

The GR-96 comes in two different versions. The XXX with 192AH battery capacity, and YYY with 96AH battery capacity. Both models have all the same functionality, but the XXX will last twice as long between charges.

## Specifications

## Battery Life

No matter which model you choose, you can expect the GR-96 to last through a full day of use with plenty of charge remaining.

Actual battery life will vary depending on operating conditions (temperature, grade, driving habits, etc.). As a general guideline, however, you can expect:

* Model XXX to last three full days of use
* Model YYY to last one and a half days of use

If you feel that the battery life of your GR-96 is significantly less, visit the [troubleshooting section](/troubleshooting/battery-capacity) to learn how to test your battery.

## Charging

Please do not use a charger other than the one provided by ZERO Turf Machines. Use of an unapproved charger will void the warranty.

Refer to the [Charging Instructions](/operations/charging) for details on how to charge the battery.
