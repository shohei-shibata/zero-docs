## General Safety Guidelines

<Aside type="caution" title="Caution">
  Do not power on, or operate the machine with any parts of the machine removed.
</Aside>

Never drive the machine off of the standing platform. 

There should only be up to one person on the machine at any time.

Ensure proper clearance around the machine at all times while operating the machine.

<Aside type="danger" title="Danger">
  Never operate the machine on slopes exceeding 15 degrees in any direction. Doing so will not only pose great danger to the operator, but is also considered a misuse of the machine and therefore will void the warranty. ZERO Turf Machines cannot be held responsible for injuries caused by such misuse. 
</Aside>

## Operating Conditions

### Maximum grade

To avoid a tip-over accident, do not operate the GR-96 on slopes greater than 15 degrees.
