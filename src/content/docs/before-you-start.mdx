## General Safety Guidelines

<Aside type="caution" title="Caution">
  Do not power on, or operate the machine with any parts of the machine removed.
</Aside>

Only drive the GR96 while standing on the platform.

There should only be one person on the machine at any time.

Ensure proper clearance around the machine at all times while operating the machine.

## Operating Conditions

### Maximum grade

<Aside type="danger" title="Danger">
  Never operate the machine on slopes exceeding 15 degrees in any direction. Doing so will not only pose great danger to the operator, but is also considered a misuse of the machine and therefore will void the warranty. ZERO Turf Machines cannot be held responsible for injuries caused by such misuse. 
</Aside>

To minimize risk for a tip-over accident, the GR96 should be operated only on slopes less than 15 degrees.

### Temperature

<Aside type="caution" title="Caution">
  For your safety and for the longevity of the batteries, do not charge the batteries at an ambient temperature below 32°F.
</Aside>

The GR96 is safe to operate in ambient temperatures as low as -20°F(-30°C) and up to 120°F(50°C). However, you may notice that the batteries of the GR96 may deplete faster than usual. This is expected and once the ambient temperature is less extreme, battery performance should return to normal as well.
