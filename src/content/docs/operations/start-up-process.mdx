## Starting

Starting a GR-96 could not be any simpler. All you have to do is to turn the ignition key to the ON position. 

The LED indicator will blink red for about 2 seconds. Wait without moving the throttle bars during this time. Once the light changes to green and you hear a short beep, it is ready to be driven.

<Aside type="note" title="What if the light stays red?">
Light will not change to green (and in drive-ready state) unless the throttle is neutral. Check to make sure that the throttle is centered. If that does not fix the problem, try [calibrating the throttle](/operations/throttle-calibration).

## Driving

### Caster Lock

The GR-96 comes with a caster lock system to assist in driving in a straight path. To activate the caster lock, simply step on the foot pedal on the right side of the platform. 

<Aside type="note" title="Note">
If you step on the foot pedal while turning, the caster lock will engage only after the vehicle is driving straight.
