To begin spreading the product,

1. Turn on the hopper motor (#4 above)
2. Open the hopper gate (#1 above)

To adjust how, and how much product is spread, refer to the next section.

## Spreader Adjustments

Overall spread rate is controlled by the rate adjust dial at the front of the hopper.

  Make sure that the machine is powered off before adjusting the rate adjust dial.

The spread width is controlled by the hopper motor speed dial.

The Spread Pattern Control cable (#2 above) can be used to focus the product spread on the left side, right side, or to spread evenly in all directions.

Finally, use the Deflector (#3 above) to limit the spread on the left side when needed (such as when spreading near the edge of a property).
