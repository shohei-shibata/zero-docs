  Ensure that the hopper motor is turned off before making any adjustment to the hopper system.

## Spreader Operation

To operate the spreader, simply open the gate and turn on the hopper motor. The hopper motor control is located on the top left corner of the dashboard.

The gate and the deflector can be controlled using the push-pull cable handles located by the spedometer on the right side of the cockpit.

## Spreader Adjustments

Use the gate dial located on the front of the hopper to adjust the rate at which the granular material comes out. The hopper motor speed dial on the dashboard will affect how far the material will spread, and finally the deflector will reduce spread on the left side when desired.
